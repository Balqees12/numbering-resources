Develop an endpoint that will take an area code, access code and qty (quantity of numbers an applicant is willing to buy/apply for), min and max numbers.

The list/range of numbers to buy is automatically selected between the RANGE START(Min) and RANGE END (Max) as indicated on the table and each time the total number is depleted such that those numbers returned are made unavailable for yet another user/call to the endpoint.

The API should have an authentication header configured for access. This means you are to include access and refresh tokens.

Develop using Spring Boot

Application server runs on port localhost port 8080
